****************************************************************************

### Ayberk Yaşa:
### ~ 23.03-29.03 ~
This week I thought about the design of each mode in our game. I participated in brainstorm for UI Stage and I shared professional design ideas from my proficient perspective.

### ~ 30.03-05.04 ~
This week I researched user interface design with Swing. I tried to learn some key points of using Swing. I watched video series about Swing Tool Kit in Netbeans, which is conducive to game programming process.

### ~ 06.04-12.04 ~
This week I continued to watch video series about using Swing in Netbeans and broaden my knowledge of user interface.

### ~ 13.04-19.04 ~
This week I created a new GitHub account and joined our GitHub repository. I learned the fundamental of the usage of GitHub. I tried to write simple programs with Swing Tool Kit and add basic user interface designs to my lab assignments for their menus.

### ~ 20.04-26.04 ~
This week I thought about the classes of our game and I researched MVC which is an architectural pattern for computer engineering. I determined the number and kinds of panels that we will need in the game.

### ~ 27.04-03.05 ~
This week I create AlgoZoo Project File in our GitHub repository. I started to design images that will be used in the game. I designed several backgrounds and many buttons, which will appear in the menu, through Adobe Photoshop CC. I started coding to make the menu dynamic. Together with Görkem, we wrote view classes in accordance with MVC principles.

### ~ 04.05-10.05 ~
This week I expanded the menu more compared to the previous week. I made more designs than last week and implemented them all to the game by adding GUI classes. Together with Görkem, we have made one of the game modes in almost running order.

### ~ 11.05-17.05 ~
This week I made some design corrections as a result of the feedback of the group members. For example, several background images have been improved and adapted to existing plugins. The designs of the view and controller classes have been completed by me. I revised the codes written for these classes. Moreover, I made dozens of new button designs and the information screen panel. I integrated all of them into the game.

### ~ 18.05-24.05 ~
This week I had to make updates in the controller class for the for loop added to the game and I had to add new characters to the game. I took care of these. I made another design to fulfill the end of the game screen need. After handling these three design requirements, I corrected the codes and integrated them into the game. Moreover, I recoded a class that I thought was written inefficiently. I focused on the shortcomings in the save feature added by Görkem and fixed the several corresponding bugs. Then, we decided to make the CodeView class more efficient. Me and Görkem worked on the for loop appearing in CodeView class. However, we encountered a thorny problem and I desired to examine the code that I wrote in detail. I traced the code several times for 6 hours. Although I printed the value of an "x" variable on the console, I realized that when I used this variable, I got a different value. I gave up thinking that this problem was not caused by me.

****************************************************************************

### Kerem Erdal:
### ~ 23.03.2020 ~
This week I though about he interface design, and searched for how to make it more appealing. I though about the details of the game and created some opinions about making it more interesting. I wrote the part about play screen and conclusion of the User Interface Report.

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week I searched for how to use a Swing Tool. I watched some videos to learn how these tools work and started to think how I can write codes of the games by using these tools.

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I considered about the detailed design of the project and shared my ideas with my friends. I continued watching videos about usage of Swing Tools and increased myknowledge about that topic to ensure what sort of a design would be more appropriate. 

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week I created my acccount on GitHub and made some research to understand how it works. I joined to our project repository and practiced MVC and how I would implement our interfaces and integrate them with the MVC pattern

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week I continued brainstorming about MVC nd its usage in our project. I started writing our beforehand meeting logs to our GitHub repository. I though about the classes, panels and interfaces and shared my ideas with my friends to give the last decision about the classes according to MVC.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week according to created detailed design and prepared MVC, I firstly wrote the animal class with its appropriate properties and methods with Arda. In addition, I created the selection controller class of the test mode with its required methods according to our project design with Arda. In the following times of the week, I thought about changing the labels according to the movement patterns, made some research and decided to create an arraylist to put all labels, to which images would be implemented according to appropriate action listener. Therefore, I changed the selection controller class to make it more useful.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week I searched for how to add the appropriate icon to the label in Swing Tool, and did some practice to make sure that I understood the process correctly. I changed the selection controller class of the test mode to set the labels appropriate icons instead of just showing a text. On a paper, I designed the GUI of Test Mode similar to the one planned while writing the Graphical User Interface Report and then thought about how to write suitable methods through tracing and critically thinking. After deciding on the design, I wrote the appropriate methods, codes and placed the parts of the interface according to the planned design with Arda. I updated the menu class accordingly to display the test mode on the game. I fixed some minor bugs in the TestMode GUI and TestModeSelectionController classes and created a working test mode for our game with Arda.

*****************************************************************************

### Arda İçöz:
### ~ 23.03.2020 ~
This week I thought about creative mode by planning how can it be implemented into the game and is it possible to do this game mode or not.

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week passed by learning NetBeans' s Swing Tool. I watched some videos and searched some examples in sites like StackOverflow.

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I started to plan and think the classes we can possibly use in our game.

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week with GitHub and MVC, I started to practice and tried to learn better about MVC to plan the models, views and controllers and understand how they work.

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week, planning our classes (using MVC) continued with my friends. We came to the near end of finishing every essential class for our game.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week, according to our project design, Kerem and I designed the Animal class and SelectionController class for Test mode. Then, we did some improvements to SelectionController class by adding all labels to a ArrayList. 

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week, I did some more practice with Swing Tool to not face any problems while implementing it to our actual project. With Kerem, we designed and wrote the source code of the GUI for the Test mode. Then, with updating the MenuScreen class accordingly to our updates and fixing some bugs, we created a fully functioning Test mode.

*****************************************************************************

### Alp Tuğrul Ağçalı:
### ~ 23.03.2020 - 29.03.2020 ~
I tried to find new ideas to improve our project. I looked the feedbachs our TA and other grups gave us. I watched videos about the using NetBeans. Then Esra, Doğa and ı explained the details about the user interface of the learn mode, challenge mode, test mode and general map of the game for the User Interface Report.

### ~ 30.03.2020 - 05.04.2020 ~
I learned the NetBeans swing tools because it is neccesary for the user interface in game and I tried to find ideas for detailed design of project.

### ~ 13.04.2020 - 19.04.2020 ~
I learn how to use GitHub and I create new account to join our repository.

### ~ 20.04.2020 - 26.04.2020 ~ 
I tried to undertstand MVC and thought about how can we implement it to our project.

### ~ 27.04.2020 - 03.05.2020 
Next day, Esra, Doğa and I made some changes and additions to TimerController, LearnModeModel and ChallengeModeModel classes. We did a two-hour zoom meeting.
I created and updated the PlayButtonController class for learn and challenge modes but it is deleted because we realized that adding a button to selection controller is more efficent than creating a class.
Esra, Doğa and I made some changes to the AlgoZooModel and AlgoZoo classes. We did a one-hour zoom meeting.

### ~ 04.05.2020 - 10.05.2020 ~
Then, Esra, Doğa and I made some additions and changes to it. We did a two-hour zoom meeting. We designed the basic structure of the challenge mode and updated MenuScreen class to add ChallengeModeGUI.

*********************************************************************************

### Görkem Ayten:
### ~ 23.03.2020 ~
This week I thought about the design of the project. I also examined the designs of games that are similar to our game on the internet. So new ideas came up in my head. I also started working on the GUI that we started to see this semester.

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week I started to think about the design of the levels after our group meeting. Furthermore, since I do not know how to use netbeans swing tool,I started to learn how to use it by doing research on the internet.

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I  thought about how to make a game map where the animals would move. I examined the designs in the sample games on the the Internet.

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week I created a new GitHub account and joined our GitHub repository. I learned the fundamental of the usage of GitHub. I decided how the views of the maps would be.After that, I thought about using Photoshop by creating the map's view. So, we discussed with Ayberk which program we can use to create maps. We finally decided to use TiledMap. Therefore, I started to learn how to use TiledMap and watch some lectures about it.

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week, I continued watching videos and making map designs. I designed some learn map and I got the opinions of Ayberk in about my designs. Moreover, I found new components for my map design. So, I decided to change my design.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week after group meeting, we divided into 3 different sub-groups. I and Ayberk started to coding menu dynamics such as (panels, buttons, labels...). We also did research  to resize our project as well. I sent a message to the experts on this subject. In addition, we wrote our problem to the forum in MOODLE page. However, I learned that this is not possible because of the null layout we use.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week, with the consensus of the group members, we decided to make the game in fixed size. Therefore, I had to resize the map designs I made before. I coded MapView, CodeView and LearnMode's class together with Ayberk. While doing this, we encountered many problems and researched their solutions. We have substantially completed code of these classes.

### ~ 10.05.2020 ~
This week, I finished all map designs. I found a more effective way to start the levels by assigning variables in the LearnMode class together with Ayberk. I made adjustments to the code accordingly. Furthermore, I did research on the basic needs of the game such as how to save the level.
