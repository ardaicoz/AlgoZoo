On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 23.03.2020 ~
This week I thought about creative mode by planning how can it be implemented into the game and is it possible to do this game mode or not.

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week passed by learning NetBeans' s Swing Tool. I watched some videos and searched some examples in sites like StackOverflow.

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I started to plan and think the classes we can possibly use in our game.

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week with GitHub and MVC, I started to practice and tried to learn better about MVC to plan the models, views and controllers and understand how they work.

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week, planning our classes (using MVC) continued with my friends. We came to the near end of finishing every essential class for our game.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week, according to our project design, Kerem and I designed the Animal class and SelectionController class for Test mode. Then, we did some improvements to SelectionController class by adding all labels to a ArrayList. 

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week, I did some more practice with Swing Tool to not face any problems while implementing it to our actual project. With Kerem, we designed and wrote the source code of the GUI for the Test mode. Then, with updating the MenuScreen class accordingly to our updates and fixing some bugs, we created a fully functioning Test mode.
