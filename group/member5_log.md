On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 23.03.2020 ~
This week I thought about creative mode by planning how can it be implemented into the game and is it possible to do this game mode or not.

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week passed by learning NetBeans' s Swing Tool. I watched some videos and searched some examples in sites like StackOverflow.

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I started to plan and think the classes we can possibly use in our game.

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week with GitHub and MVC, I started to practice and tried to learn better about MVC to plan the models, views and controllers and understand how they work.

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week, planning our classes (using MVC) continued with my friends. We came to the near end of finishing every essential class for our game.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week, according to our project design, Kerem and I designed the Animal class and SelectionController class for Test mode. Then, we did some improvements to SelectionController class by adding all labels to a ArrayList. 

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week, I did some more practice with Swing Tool to not face any problems while implementing it to our actual project. With Kerem, we designed and wrote the source code of the GUI for the Test mode. Then, with updating the MenuScreen class accordingly to our updates and fixing some bugs, we created a fully functioning Test mode.

### ~ 11.05.2020 ~
This week, with Kerem we fixed bugs when user wants to restart a level in test mode and fixed the character to return to its first location when restarted.
We implemented TestModeGUI according to the TestLevels class by creating parameters which gets appropriate options for every level.
We wrote the text for "How to Play" button which is located in bottom right corner.

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~ 
This week I wrote the appropriate parameters for the last five levels of the Test Mode by determining the start and end locations of the character and locations of the flowers.
Later, with realising the options being not challenging, I updated them to be more difficult.
With Kerem, we did the appropriate changes for the added Flower icon such as changing the related icons in label, and its related methods like gathering the pollens to TestModeSelectionController, TestLevels and TestModeGUI classes.
For the video, I discussed about the content of the video with Doğa and Kerem.
With Kerem, we wrote the missing javadoc comments in Test Mode, fixed the indentation and variable declaration; later I added some javadoc comments for learn and challenge modes.
With Kerem, we wrote the explanations for Test Mode for Detailed Design Report.
