On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 23.03.2020 ~
This week I thought about the design of the project. I also examined the designs of games that are similar to our game on the internet. A few good examples took my attention. Therefore, new ideas came up in my head. I also started working on the GUI that we started to see this semester.

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week I started to think about the design of the levels after our group meeting. Furthermore, since I do not know how to use Netbeans swing tool, I started to learn how to use it by doing research on the internet and watching videos.

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I thought about how to make a game map where the animals would move. I thought designing the maps of game with Unity. I researched on the use of unity. Moreover, I examined the designs in the sample games on the Internet.

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week I created a new GitHub account and joined our GitHub repository. I learned the fundamental of the usage of GitHub. I decided how the views of the maps would be. After that, I thought about using Photoshop by creating the map's view. I did not get any results from the udemy videos I watched a week ago. So, we discussed with Ayberk which program we can use to create maps. We finally decided to use TiledMap. Therefore, I started to learn how to use TiledMap and watch some videos about it.

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week, I continued watching videos and making map designs. I designed some Learn Mode’s map and I got the opinions of Ayberk in about my designs. Moreover, I found new components for my map design. So, I decided to change my design.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week after group meeting, we divided into 3 different sub-groups. I and Ayberk started to coding menu dynamics such as (panels, buttons, labels...). We also did research to resize our project as well. I sent a message to the experts on this subject. In addition, we wrote our problem to the forum in MOODLE page. However, I learned that this is not possible because of the null layout we use. Moreover, I started to think about the model classes we decided in group work.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week, with the consensus of the group members, we decided to make the game in fixed size. Therefore, I had to resize the map designs I made before. I coded MapView, CodeView and LearnMode's class together with Ayberk. While doing this, we encountered many problems and researched their solutions. We have substantially completed code of these classes.

### ~ 10.05.2020 ~
This week, I finished Learn Mode, Challenge Mode and Test Mode’ s map designs. I found a more effective way to start the levels by assigning variables in the LearnMode class together with Ayberk. I made adjustments to the code accordingly. Furthermore, I did research on the basic needs of the game such as how to save the level. I found a lot of resources about java IO on the internet. I tried to integrate what I learned into our own project.

### ~ 17.05.2020 ~
This week, I started working to complete the deficiencies such as sound after pressing the button and lack of save files we decided to meet with the group. So, I continued working for the game's save files. I wrote 6 different save classes for this and integrated it into the project. After that, I made changes to the code to fix the errors I encountered. Finally our game could be saved without any problems. Me and Ayberk worked on the for loop that located in CodeView class. However, we faced with some problems and did not fix it. I completed all the deficiencies I could complete and made the project ready for delivery. Finally, our project is completed.
