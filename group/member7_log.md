On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 23.03.2020 ~
This week I thought about the design of the project. I also examined the designs of games that are similar to our game on the internet. So new ideas came up in my head. I also started working on the GUI that we started to see this semester.

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week I started to think about the design of the levels after our group meeting. Furthermore, since I do not know how to use netbeans swing tool,I started to learn how to use it by doing research on the internet.

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I  thought about how to make a game map where the animals would move. I examined the designs in the sample games on the the Internet.

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week I created a new GitHub account and joined our GitHub repository. I learned the fundamental of the usage of GitHub. I decided how the views of the maps would be.After that, I thought about using Photoshop by creating the map's view. So, we discussed with Ayberk which program we can use to create maps. We finally decided to use TiledMap. Therefore, I started to learn how to use TiledMap and watch some lectures about it.

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week, I continued watching videos and making map designs. I designed some learn map and I got the opinions of Ayberk in about my designs. Moreover, I found new components for my map design. So, I decided to change my design.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week after group meeting, we divided into 3 different sub-groups. I and Ayberk started to coding menu dynamics such as (panels, buttons, labels...). We also did research  to resize our project as well. I sent a message to the experts on this subject. In addition, we wrote our problem to the forum in MOODLE page. However, I learned that this is not possible because of the null layout we use.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week, with the consensus of the group members, we decided to make the game in fixed size. Therefore, I had to resize the map designs I made before. I coded MapView, CodeView and LearnMode's class together with Ayberk. While doing this, we encountered many problems and researched their solutions. We have substantially completed code of these classes.

### ~ 10.05.2020 ~
This week, I finished all map designs. I found a more effective way to start the levels by assigning variables in the LearnMode class together with Ayberk. I made adjustments to the code accordingly. Furthermore, I did research on the basic needs of the game such as how to save the level.
