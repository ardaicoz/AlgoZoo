On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 23.03.2020 - 29.03.2020 ~
This week I tried to find new ideas to improve our game and I read the feedbacks that other groups and TAs gave us again. Also, I watched videos about Netbeans to be able to use it more properly.
Then, Esra, Alp and I explained the details about the user interface of the learn mode, challenge mode, test mode and general map of the game for the User Interface Report.

### ~ 30.03.2020 - 05.04.2020 ~
This week I started to learn about NetBeans' Swing Tool which is necessary for the game's user interface.
I also started to brainstorm ideas for the detailed design of our project.

### ~ 13.04.2020 - 19.04.2020 ~
This week I created a Github account and joined our repository. Also, I learned how to use Github by watching the video.

### ~ 20.04.2020 - 26.04.2020 ~
This week I learned more about MVC by watching videos and reading the course book. Also, I thought about how we can implement MVC to our project. 

### ~ 27.04.2020 - 03.05.2020 ~
This week I helped Esra brainstorm ideas for MVC design of our project. We did a three-hour zoom meeting. 
Then, we added and updated game package, learn package and challenge package. We again did a three-hour zoom meeting.
Next day, Esra, Alp and I made some changes and additions to TimerController, LearnModeModel and ChallengeModeModel classes. We did a two-hour zoom meeting.
I created and updated the SelectionController class for learn and challenge modes.
Esra, Alp and I made some changes to the AlgoZooModel and AlgoZoo classes. We did a one-hour zoom meeting. 

### ~ 04.05.2020 - 10.05.2020 ~
This week I created and updated ChallengeModeGUI class.
Then, Esra, Alp and I made some additions and changes to it because we decided to remove the parameters of the constructor in order to add it to the design of the MenuScreen. We did a two-hour zoom meeting. We designed the basic structure of the challenge mode and updated MenuScreen class to add ChallengeModeGUI.
Esra and I tried to find an efficient way to add ActionListeners to every button in LevelsGUI classes. We decided to form for loops as a solution. We also improved returnButtonActionPerformed method. 

### ~ 11.05.2020 - 17.05.2020 ~
This week Esra, Alp and I completed the System Overview and Core Design Details parts of the Detailed Design Report.
Then, we fixed some minor bugs in TimerController, SelectionController and each modes' GUI classes. 
I changed the movement methods to prevent the changes in the location of the animal if the user tries to cross the border of the map.
Esra, Alp and I implemented the code for the efficiency stars in the challenge mode and created the animal selection part in the mode screen.

### ~ 18.05.2020 - 24.05.2020 ~
This week, Esra, Alp and I added the necessary comments and javadoc comments to the classes in game and challenge packages. We fixed the bugs in TimerController class.
Then, we implemented the system of the for loop function to SelectionController class and we designed the for loop function's JComboBox to make it more appealing. We added the endMessage() method to the MapView class to inform the users when they lose or pass the levels. We also added the retryButton to each mode for users to be able to restart the levels when they lose.
I updated the levels of the challenge mode according to the locations of the flowers.
Then, I added some comments and made some editing to the challenge and game packages to organize the code and make it more clear.
I also explained the properties and methods of ChallengeLevels, ChallengeModeGUI, ChallengeModeLevelsGUI, TimerController, LevelButton and SelectionController classes for the updated Detailed Design Report.
