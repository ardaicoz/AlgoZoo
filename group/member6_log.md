### ~ 23.03.2020 - 29.03.2020 ~
I tried to find new ideas to improve our project. I looked the feedbachs our TA and other grups gave us. I watched videos about the using NetBeans. Then Esra, Doğa and ı explained the details about the user interface of the learn mode, challenge mode, test mode and general map of the game for the User Interface Report.

### ~ 30.03.2020 - 05.04.2020 ~
I learned the NetBeans swing tools because it is neccesary for the user interface in game and I tried to find ideas for detailed design of project.

### ~ 20.04.2020 - 26.04.2020 ~ 
I tried to undertstand MVC and thought about how can we implement it to our project.

### ~ 27.04.2020 - 03.05.2020 
Next day, Esra, Doğa and I made some changes and additions to TimerController, LearnModeModel and ChallengeModeModel classes. We did a two-hour zoom meeting.
I created and updated the PlayButtonController class for learn and challenge modes but it is deleted because we realized that adding a button to selection controller is more efficent than creating a class.
Esra, Doğa and I made some changes to the AlgoZooModel and AlgoZoo classes. We did a one-hour zoom meeting.

### ~ 04.05.2020 - 10.05.2020 ~
Then, Esra, Doğa and I made some additions and changes to it. We did a two-hour zoom meeting. We designed the basic structure of the challenge mode and updated MenuScreen class to add ChallengeModeGUI.
