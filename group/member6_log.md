### ~ 23.03.2020 - 29.03.2020 ~
I tried to find new ideas to improve our project. I looked the feedbachs our TA and other grups gave us. I watched videos about the using NetBeans. Then Esra, Doğa and ı explained the details about the user interface of the learn mode, challenge mode, test mode and general map of the game for the User Interface Report.

### ~ 30.03.2020 - 05.04.2020 ~
I learned the NetBeans swing tools because it is neccesary for the user interface in game and I tried to find ideas for detailed design of project.

### ~ 13.04.2020 - 19.04.2020 ~
I learn how to use GitHub and I create new account to join our repository.

### ~ 20.04.2020 - 26.04.2020 ~ 
I tried to undertstand MVC and thought about how can we implement it to our project.

### ~ 27.04.2020 - 03.05.2020 
Esra, Doğa and I made some changes and additions to TimerController, LearnModeModel and ChallengeModeModel classes. We did a two-hour zoom meeting.
I created and updated the PlayButtonController class for learn and challenge modes but it is deleted because we realized that adding a button to selection controller is more efficent than creating a class.
Esra, Doğa and I made some changes to the AlgoZooModel and AlgoZoo classes. We did a one-hour zoom meeting.

### ~ 04.05.2020 - 10.05.2020 ~
Esra, Doğa and I made some additions and changes to it. We did a two-hour zoom meeting. We designed the basic structure of the challenge mode and updated MenuScreen class to add ChallengeModeGUI.

### ~ 11.05.2020 - 17.05.2020 ~
This week Esra, Doğa and I completed the System Overview and Core Design Details parts of the Detailed Design Report.
Then, we fixed some minor bugs in TimerController, SelectionController and each modes' GUI classes. 
Esra, Doğa and I implemented the code for the efficiency stars in the challenge mode and created the animal selection part in the mode screen.
I also added some comments.

### ~ 18.05.2020 - 24.05.2020 ~
This week, Esra, Doğa and I added the necessary comments and javadoc comments to the classes in game and challenge packages. We fixed the bugs in TimerController class.
Then, we implemented the system of the for loop function to SelectionController class and we designed the for loop function's JComboBox to make it more appealing. We added the endMessage() method to the MapView class to inform the users when they lose or pass the levels. We also added the retryButton to each mode for users to be able to restart the levels when they lose.
I also fixed minor bugs in ChallengeModeGui, SelectionController, LearnModeGui and TestModeGui.
