On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 23.03.2020 - 29.03.2020 ~
This week I focused on how to improve our game with the help of feedbacks that other groups and TAs gave us. Also, I downloaded Netbeans and watched videos about how to use this IDE.
Then, Doğa, Alp and I wrote the details about the user interface of the learn mode, challenge mode, test mode and general map of the game for the User Interface Report.

### ~ 30.03.2020 - 05.04.2020 ~
This week I learned more about NetBeans' Swing Tool.
I also started to brainstorm ideas for the detailed design of our project.

### ~ 13.04.2020 - 19.04.2020 ~
This week I created a Github account and joined our repository.

### ~ 20.04.2020 - 26.04.2020 ~
This week I learned more about MVC design pattern and worked on the detailed design of the project. 
Doğa and I started creating a detailed design of the project and tried to determine what type of classes are necessary for our game.
Then we shared our ideas with our group members.

### ~ 27.04.2020 - 03.05.2020  ~
This week Alp, Doğa and I started to implement model classes of te project. We decided what properties and methods are needed and implemented them accordingly. 
I also learned more about the javax.swing.Timer class and built the TimerController class that displays the remaining time to complete a level for the project.

### ~ 04.05.2020 - 10.05.2020 ~
I worked on the ChallengeModeGUI class with Doğa and Alp. We had a two-hour Zoom meeting. We tried to fix the problems about adding it to the MenuScreen class and we put the components in their places.
Doğa and I tried to come up with an efficient solution to add ActionListeners to every button in LevelsGUI classes and we formed for loops to add ActionListeners as a solution. We also improved returnButtonActionPerformed method. 
After everyone committed the GUI panels, I fixed some of the bugs in the game.

### ~ 11.05.2020 - 17.05.2020 ~
I worked on how to create and display levels for Challenge mode with Doğa and Alp. We did the implementation accordingly.
Alp, Doğa and I created the animal selection system for choosing an animal to play with on the mode screen and we developed a system for displaying efficiency stars on ChallengeModeLevelsGUI screen.
We also found some bugs in the TimerController class and fixed them.

### ~ 18.05.2020 - 24.05.2020 ~
I tried to come up with a system to add for loop feature to the game. For this system, I learned how to use and design JToggleBuutton and JComboBox.
Alp, Doğa and I implemented this system to SelectionController class.
I worked on how to display the code in the CodeView class when it is too long to fit the screen. I added scroll function to the game with two buttons and MouseWheel Event.
I played the game and found some bugs to fix, and fixed them to improve the game.
I did a code check for the project, turned all the properties to private, added missing javadocs and comments.
