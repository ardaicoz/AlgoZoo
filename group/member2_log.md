On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 23.03.2020 - 29.03.2020 ~
This week I focused on how to improve our game with the help of feedbacks that other groups and TAs gave us again. Also, I downloaded Netbeans and watched videos about how to use this IDE.
Then, Esra, Alp and I explained the details about the user interface of the learn mode, challenge mode, test mode and general map of the game for the User Interface Report.

This week I started to learn about NetBeans' Swing Tool.
I also started to brainstorm ideas for the detailed design of our project.

### ~ 13.04.2020 - 19.04.2020 ~
This week I created a Github account and joined our repository.

### ~ 20.04.2020 - 26.04.2020 ~
This week I learned more about MVC design pattern and worked on the detailed design of the project. 
Doğa and I started creating a detailed design of the project and shared it with our group members.

### ~ 27.04.2020 - 03.05.2020  ~
This week Alp, Doğa and I worked on AlgoZoo, AlgoZooModel and ChallengeModel classes. We decided what properties and methods are needed and implemented them accordingly. 
I also learned more about the timer class and built the TimerController class for the project.

### ~ 04.05.2020 - 10.05.2020 ~
I worked on the ChallengeModeGUI class with Doğa and Alp. We had a two-hour Zoom meeting where we tried to fix the problems about adding it to the MenuScreen class.
After everyone committed the GUI panels, I fixed some of the bugs in the game.
