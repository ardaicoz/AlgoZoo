On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 23.03.2020 ~
This week I though about he interface design, and searched for how to make it more appealing. I though about the details of the game and created some opinions about making it more interesting. I wrote the part about play screen and conclusion of the User Interface Report.

### ~ 30.03.2020 ~
This week I searched for how to use a Swing Tool. I watched some videos to learn how these tools work and started to think how I can write codes of the games by using these tools.

### ~ 06.04.2020 ~
This week I considered about the detailed design of the project and shared my ideas with my friends. I continued watching videos about usage of Swing Tools and increased myknowledge about that topic to ensure what sort of a design would be more appropriate. 

### ~ 13.04.2020 ~
This week I created my acccount on GitHub and made some research to understand how it works. I joined to our project repository and practiced MVC and how I would implement our interfaces and integrate them with the MVC pattern

### ~ 20.04.2020 ~
This week I continued brainstorming about MVC nd its usage in our project. I started writing our beforehand meeting logs to our GitHub repository. I though about the classes, panels and interfaces and shared my ideas with my friends to give the last decision about the classes according to MVC.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week according to created detailed design and prepared MVC, I firstly wrote the animal class with its appropriate properties and methods with Arda. In addition, I created the selection controller class of the test mode with its required methods according to our project design with Arda. In the following times of the week, I thought about changing the labels according to the movement patterns, made some research and decided to create an arraylist to put all labels, to which images would be implemented according to appropriate action listener. Therefore, I changed the selection controller class to make it more useful.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
This week I searched for how to add the appropriate icon to the label in Swing Tool, and did some practice to make sure that I understood the process correctly. I changed the selection controller class of the test mode to set the labels appropriate icons instead of just showing a text. On a paper, I designed the GUI of Test Mode similar to the one planned while writing the Graphical User Interface Report and then thought about how to write suitable methods through tracing and critically thinking. After deciding on the design, I wrote the appropriate methods, codes and placed the parts of the interface according to the planned design with Arda. I updated the menu class accordingly to display the test mode on the game. I fixed some minor bugs in the TestMode GUI and TestModeSelectionController classes and created a working test mode for our game with Arda.
