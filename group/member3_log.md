On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 23.03-29.03 ~
This week I thought about the design of each mode in our game. I participated in brainstorm for UI Stage and I shared professional design ideas from my proficient perspective.

### ~ 30.03-05.04 ~
This week I researched user interface design with Swing. I tried to learn some key points of using Swing. I watched video series about Swing Tool Kit in Netbeans, which is conducive to game programming process.

### ~ 06.04-12.04 ~
This week I continued to watch video series about using Swing in Netbeans and broaden my knowledge of user interface.

### ~ 13.04-19.04 ~
This week I created a new GitHub account and joined our GitHub repository. I learned the fundamental of the usage of GitHub. I tried to write simple programs with Swing Tool Kit and add basic user interface designs to my lab assignments for their menus.

### ~ 20.04-26.04 ~
This week I thought about the classes of our game and I researched MVC which is an architectural pattern for computer engineering. I determined the number and kinds of panels that we will need in the game.

### ~ 27.04-03.05 ~
This week I create AlgoZoo Project File in our GitHub repository. I started to design images that will be used in the game. I designed several backgrounds and many buttons, which will appear in the menu, through Adobe Photoshop CC. I started coding to make the menu dynamic. Together with Görkem, we wrote view classes in accordance with MVC principles.

### ~ 04.05-10.05 ~
This week I expanded the menu more compared to the previous week. I made more designs than last week and implemented them all to the game by adding GUI classes. Together with Görkem, we have made one of the game modes in almost running order.

### ~ 11.05-17.05 ~
This week I made some design corrections as a result of the feedback of the group members. For example, several background images have been improved and adapted to existing plugins. The designs of the view and controller classes have been completed by me. I revised the codes written for these classes. Moreover, I made dozens of new button designs and the information screen panel. I integrated all of them into the game.

### ~ 18.05-24.05 ~
This week I had to make updates in the controller class for the for loop added to the game and I had to add new characters to the game. I took care of these. I made another design to fulfill the end of the game screen need. After handling these three design requirements, I corrected the codes and integrated them into the game. Moreover, I recoded a class that I thought was written inefficiently. I focused on the shortcomings in the save feature added by Görkem and fixed the several corresponding bugs. Then, we decided to make the CodeView class more efficient. Me and Görkem worked on the for loop appearing in CodeView class. However, we encountered a thorny problem and I desired to examine the code that I wrote in detail. I traced the code several times for 6 hours. Although I printed the value of an "x" variable on the console, I realized that when I used this variable, I got a different value. I gave up thinking that this problem was not caused by me.
